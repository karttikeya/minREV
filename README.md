A PyTorch reimplementation of [Reversible Vision Transformer](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Mangalam_Reversible_Vision_Transformers_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf) architecture that is prefers simplicity over ~~tricks~~, hackability over ~~tedious organization~~, and interpretability over ~~generality~~. 

It is meant to serve as an educational guide for newcomers that are not familiar with the reversible backpropagation algorithm and reversible vision transformer. 

The entire Reversible Vision Transformer is implemented from scratch in under **<300 lines** of pytorch code, including the memory-efficient reversible backpropagation algorithm (**<100 lines**). Even the driver code is < 150 lines. The repo supports both memory-efficient training and testing on CIFAR-10.

<h2> Setting Up </h2>

Simple! 🌟

(if using conda for env, otherwise use pip)
```
conda create -n revvit python=3.8
conda activate revvit
conda install pytorch torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

If you wish to also use RevSwin and RevMViT, also install ```timm```.
```
conda install timm=0.9.2
```

<h2> Code Organization </h2>

The code organization is also minimal 💫:

- `rev.py` defines the reversible vision model that supports: 
    -  The vanilla backpropagation 
    -  The memory-efficient reversible backpropagation    
- `main.py` that has the driver code for training on CIFAR-10. By default, `--model vit` is enabled.
- `fast_rev.py` contains a simplified implementation of fast, parallelized reversible backpropagation (PaReprop). Use `--pareprop True` to enable. 
- `rev_swin.py` contains the reversible Swin Transformer with PaReprop functionality. Use `--model swin` to enable.
- `rev_mvit.py` and `utils.py` contain the reversible MViTv2 with PaReprop functionality. Use `--model mvit` to enable. 

## Running CIFAR-10

We currently provide three model options for reversible training: ViT, Swin, and MViT. 
The architectures in some cases have been simplified to run on CIFAR-10.

### Reversible ViT 🍦

`python main.py --lr 1e-3 --bs 128 --embed_dim 128 --depth 6 --n_head 8 --epochs 100 --model vit`

By default, the `--model` flag is set to `vit`. This will achieve `80%+` validation accuracy on CIFAR-10 from scratch training! 

Here are the [Training/Validation Logs](https://api.wandb.ai/links/action_anticipation/d0hqnv67) 💯 

`python main.py --lr 1e-3 --bs 128 --embed_dim 128 --depth 6 --n_head 8 --epochs 100 --model vit --vanilla_bp True`

Will train the same network but without memory-efficient backpropagation to the same accuracy as above.
Hence, there is no accuracy drop from the memory-efficient reversible backpropagation.  

Here are the [Training/Validation Logs](https://api.wandb.ai/links/action_anticipation/r7k0v3kd) 💯 

### Reversible Swin 🐬

`python main.py --lr 1e-3 --bs 128 --embed_dim 128 --depth 4 --n_head 4 --epochs 100 --model swin`

This will achieve `80%+` validation accuracy on CIFAR-10 from scratch training for a Reversible Swin!

### Reversible MViT 🏰

`python main.py --lr 1e-3 --bs 128 --embed_dim 64 --depth 4 --n_head 1 --epochs 100 --model mvit`

This will achieve `90%+` validation accuracy on CIFAR-10 from scratch training for a Reversible MViT!

You can find Training/Validation Logs for both Swin and MViT [here](https://api.wandb.ai/links/tyleryzhu/rt2amae6) 💯 

👁️ **Note**: The relatively low accuracy is due to difficulty in training vision transformer (reversible or vanilla) from scratch on small datasets like CIFAR-10. Also likely is that a much higher accuracy can be achieved with the same code, using a better [chosen model design and optimization parameters](https://github.com/tysam-code/hlb-CIFAR10). The authors have done no tuning since this repository is meant for understanding code, not pushing performance. 

<h2> Mixed precision training </h2>

Mixed precision training is also supported and can be enabled by adding `--amp True` flag to above commands. Training progresses smoothly and achieves `80%+` validation accuracy on CIFAR-10 similar to training without AMP. 


📝  **Note**: Pytorch vanilla AMP, maintains full precision (fp32) on weights and only uses half-precision (fp16) on intermediate activations. Since reversible is already saving up on almost all intermediate activations (see video for examplanation), using AMP (ie half-precision on activations) brings little additional memory savings. For example, on a 16G V100 setup, AMP can improve rev maximum CIFAR-10 batch size from `12000` to `14500` ( `~20%`). At usual training batch size (`128`) there is small gain in GPU training memory (about 4%). 

<h2> Distributed Data Parallel Training </h2>

There are no additional overheads for DDP training with reversible that progresses the same as vanilla training. All results in [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04869) (also see below) are obtained in DDP setups (`>64` GPUs per run). However, implementing distributed training is not commensurate with the purpose of this repo, and instead can be found in the pyslowfast [distributed training setup](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SlowFast/blob/99a655bd533d7fddd7f79509e3dfaae811767b5c/slowfast/models/build.py#L69-L83).
